Preface for the mfakto-0.15pre5 testing version

This version is tested to provide correct results. But it is preliminary as it
contains test code that results in slightly lower performance. This version is
intended to provide information to better optimize the final version.

To run this test and help improve mfakto, extract the depot and run on an idle machine

perftestmfakto.cmd

This test will take between one and two hours, during which you should not use the
computer - at least nothing that would put measurable load on CPU or GPU.

When the script finished, zip the testresults subfolder that it created and send it
to me (bertramf@gmx.net).

Thanks for your help,
Bdot

#####################
# 0 What is mfakto? #
#####################

mfakto is the OpenCL-port of mfaktc. It aims to have the same features and functions as mfaktc.
mfaktc is a program that trial factors Mersenne numbers and which
stands for "Mersenne FAKTorisation with CUDA". Faktorisation is a mixture of the
English word "factorisation" and the German word "Faktorisierung".
mfakto is a GPU program, utilizing mostly GPU resources, but it can use the CPU for sieving.


#################
# 1 Compilation #
#################

  Requires:
- AMD APP SDK 2.5 or above is required.
- A C and C++ compiler, MSVC, GCC, etc depending on your system.


###########################
# 1.1 Compilation (Linux) #
###########################

- Install AMD APP SDK >= 2.5
- cd src
- Set AMD_APP_DIR in Makefile to the SDK's location if not installed in the default location.
- make
- mfakto should be compiled assuming no errors, in the root folder of mfakto.

#############################
# 1.2 Compilation (Windows) #
#############################

- Install AMD APP SDK >= 2.5
- Use the VS2010 solution to build the 32-bit or 64-bit binary, or
- use the Makefile to build using MinGW and gcc


####################
# 2 Running mfakto #
####################

  Requirements:
- AMD Catalyst driver, version >= 11.4
- AMD APP SDK version >= 2.5 (not required for Catalyst 11.10 or above)

Open a command shell and run 'mfakto -h' in the mfakto folder for parameters it accepts.
You may also want to check mfakto.ini for changing and tweaking mfakto.
Typically you will want to get work from a worktodo file which can be specified in mfakto.ini.

Please run the built-in selftest (mfakto -st) each time you've:
- Recompiled the code
- Downloaded a new binary from somewhere
- Changed the graphics driver
- Changed your hardware

worktodo.txt example: 
-- cut here --
Factor=bla,66362159,64,68
Factor=bla,3321932839,50,61
-- cut here --

Then run 'mfakto'. If everything is working as expected this should trial
factor M66362159 from 2^64 to 2^68 and after that trial factor
M3321932839 from 2^50 to 2^61.

######################
# 2.1 Supported GPUs #
######################

  AMD:
- R9 xxx, R7 xxx, R4 xxx
- HD7xxx
- HD5xxx, HD6xxx, including the builtin HD6xxx on AMD APUs
- HD4xxx, FireStream 92xx (no atomic operations available) *
- not supported: (kernel compilation fails): HD2xxx, HD3xxx, FireStream 91xx

* without atomics, reporting multiple factors found in the same block/grid
will not work. Tests showed that only one of the factors will be reported, 
but theoretically it could happen that even the reported factor is incorrect
(due to consisting of a mix of bytes of multiple factors). In cases when
mfakto reports a factor but the factor is incorrect (rejected by primenet),
please rerun the test of the exponent and the bitlevel on the CPU (e.g.
prime95 or mfakto -d c).

##############################
# 2.2 Running mfakto (Linux) #
##############################

- AMD APP SDK 2.5 or higher and Catalyst 11.4 or higher is required
- run mfakto
- precompiled version is currently only available for 64-bit (built on SuSE 11.4)

################################
# 2.3 Running mfakto (Windows) #
################################

- AMD Catalyst 11.4 or higher is required
- if driver < 11.10, install AMD APP SDK 2.5 and make sure
  %AMD_APP_DIR%/lib/x86_64 is in the path.
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package for your platform and
  language, e.g.
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BD512D9E-43C8-4655-81BF-9350143D5867&displaylang=de
- 64-bit and 32-bit binaries are available.

# 3 How to get work and report results from/to the primenet server #
####################################################################

Getting work:
    Step 1) go to http://www.mersenne.org/ and login with your username and
            password
    Step 2) on the menu on the left click "Manual Testing" and than
            "Assignments"
    Step 3) choose the number of assignments by choosing
            "Number of CPUs (cores) you need assignments for (maximum 12)"
            and "Number of assignments you want for each core"
    Step 4) Change "Preferred work type" to "Trial factoring"
    Step 5) click the button "Get Assignments"
    Step 6) copy&paste the "Factor=..." lines directly into the worktodo.txt
            in your mfakto directory

Start mfakto and stress your GPU! ;)

Advanced usage (extend the upper limit):
    Since mfakto works best on long running jobs you may want to extend the
    upper TF limit of your assignments a little bit. Take a look how much TF
    is usually done here: http://www.mersenne.org/various/math.php
    Lets assume that you've received an assignment like this:
        Factor=<some hex key>,78467119,65,66
    This means that primenet server assigned you to TF M78467119 from 2^65
    to 2^66. Take a look at the site noted above, those exponent should be
    TFed up to 2^71. Primenet will do this in multiple assignments (step by
    step) but since mfakto runs very fast on modern GPUs you might want to
    TF up to 2^71 or even 2^72 directly. Just replace the 66 at the end of
    the line with e.g. 72 before you start mfakto:
        e.g. Factor=<some hex key>,78467119,65,72
    When you increase the upper limit of your assignments it is important to
    report the results once you've finished up to the desired level. (Do not
    report partially results before!)



##################
# 4 Known issues #
##################

- On HD77xx, 78xx, 79xx and R series, mfakto may run very slow at 99% GPU load.
  mfakto warns about the issue during startup.
  The reason is because of the lower number of registers available to the kernels.
  Set VectorSize=2 in mfakto.ini and restart mfakto. It should be better now.
- The user interface is not hardened against malformed input. There are some
  checks but if you really try you should be able to screw it up.
- The GUI of your OS may be very laggy while running mfakto. In severe
  cases, if a single kernel invocation takes too long, Windows may decide
  the driver is faulty and reboot.
  Try lowering GridSize in mfakto.ini. Smaller grids should have better
  responsiveness at a little performance penalty. Performancewise this is not
  recommended on GPUs which can handle well over 100M/s candidates.
  If that does not help, try lowering NumStreams to 2 or even 1.
- SievePrimesAdjust works now, but is not always optimal. Test it out and
  see what the best SievePrimes is, set it and fix it by setting
  SievePrimesAdjust to 0.
- GPU is not found, fallback to CPU
  This happens on Linux when there is no X-server running, or the X-server
  is not accessible. It happens on Windows when not connected to the primay
  display (e.g. being connected through terminal services). So please try to
  run mfakto locally on the main X-display. If that fails as well or is not the case,
  then the graphics driver may be too old. Also, check the output of clinfo (part of AMD APP SDK)
  for your GPU. If the drivers and AMD APP SDK are up to date, then maybe
  your AMD GPU is not the first GPU. Try the -d switch to specify a different
  device number.

##################################################################
# 4.1 Stuff that looks like an issue but actually isn't an issue #
##################################################################

- mfakto runs slower on small ranges. Usually it doesn't make much sense to
  run mfakto with an upper limit smaller than 2^64. It is designed for trial
  factoring above 2^64 up to 2^92 (factor sizes). ==> mfakto needs
  "long runs"!
- mfakto can find factors outside the given range.
  E.g. './mfakto.exe -tf 66362159 40 41' has a high change to report
  124246422648815633 as a factor. Actually this is a factor of M66362159 but
  it's size is between 2^56 and 2^57! Of course
  './mfakto.exe -tf 66362159 56 57' will find this factor, too. The reason
  for this behaviour is that mfakto works on huge factor blocks. This is
  controlled by GridSize in mfakto.ini. The default value is 3 which means
  that mfakto runs up to 1048576 factor candidates at once (per class). So
  the last block of each class is filled up with factor candidates above the
  upper limit. While this is a huge overhead for small ranges it's safe to
  ignore it on bigger ranges. If a class contains 100 blocks the overhead is
  on average 0.5%. When a class needs 1000 blocks the overhead is 0.05%...

Read mfakto.ini and think before editing. ;)

# 6 FAQ #
#########

Q Does mfakto support multiple GPUs?
A No, but using the commandline option "-d <GPU number>" you should
  be able to specify which GPU to use for each specific mfakto instance.
  Please read the next question, too.

Q Can I run multiple instances of mfakto on the same computer?
A Yes, and in most cases this is necessary to make full use of the GPU(s) if sieving with CPU.
  If the sieve is running on the GPU(default), one instance should fully utilize
  a single GPU.
  
Q Which tasks should I assign to mfakto?
A Currently, the 73-bit-barrett kernel is the fastest one, working for factors
  from 60 bits to 73 bits. Selecting tasks for this kernel will give best
  results. The 79-bit-barrett kernel is quite fast too.

Q I modified something in the kernel files but my changes are not picked up by
  mfakto. Why not?
A Since mfakto version 0.14, mfakto tries to load precompiled kernel files.
  The ini-file parameter UseBinfile (default: mfakto_Kernels.elf) defines the
  file name of the precompiled kernels. Delete the file and restart mfakto, it
  will then compile the kernels from the source files.
