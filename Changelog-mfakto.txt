version 0.09 (2011-10-01)
- fixed bug in 72-bit kernel that might miss small factors (<48 bit)
  unfortunately, the fix slows this kernel by ~3-5%
- added test for the above bug to the selftest
- better calculation for SievePrimesAdjust

version 0.08 (2011-09-13)
- added --help and parameter checking
- exclude single-vectored 72-bit-mul24-kernel (not working with AMD APP SDK 2.5)
- removed THREADS_PER_BLOCK (no longer needed, will be selected automatically
  based on the GPU capabilities)
- removed slow 95-bit kernel (not usable anyway)
- added to mfakto.ini a config setting
  PreferKernel=mfakto_cl_barrett79|mfakto_cl_71 as HD5xxx and HD6xxx
  have their top-speed with different kernels
- tuned the settings for SievePrimesAdjust - should now be usable

version 0.07 (2011-08-10)
- vectorized barrett kernels
- re-enabled the MODBASECASE checks
- removed crash-workaround from barrett kernels
  (no longer needed since Catalyst 11.7): +3%
- fixed index-evaluation in barrett kernels
- fix for bitshifts of >31 bits in barrett kernels
- fixed a few compiler warnings
- improved error handling for bad config
- added "-d c" switch to force running on CPU
- added warning when no atomics are available
- added option for debuggable kernel code
- fixed/optimized limits for preprocessing on CPU

version 0.06 (2011-07-09)
- ported barrett kernels for 79 and 92 bit factor sizes
- added support for GPUs without atomics (HD4xxx)
- dropped 2- and 16-wide vectors
- optimization in the 24-bit kernels: +3%
- added a few testcases to the short selftest
- SievePrimes auto-adjust now working (still not optimal)
- slightly faster sieve-initialization per class

version 0.05 (2011-06-19)
- fixed 72-bit subtraction (in various places) as per TheJudger's comment
  on www.mersenneforum.org - Thanks for the hint!
- fixed boundaries for 95-bit kernel (-st failures)
- added vectorized versions of the 72-bit kernel (2, 4, 8, 16 wide)
- added VectorSize config item to select one of the vectorized kernels
- added GridSize=4 (up to 2M threads per grid)
- combined the "if (a>b) sub(a,b)" to a "sub_if_gt" without any "if"s
  (only conditional moves - prerequisite for the vector approach)
- moved the new DETAILED_INFO and CL_PERFORMANCE_INFO debug defines to
  params.h
- added GPLv3 headers everywhere

version 0.04 (2011-06-09)
- first version to go out to some people
- cleanup of
  - unused code
	- cuda-references and workarounds
  - removed OpenCL-example-code
- merged in the signal handler from mfaktc 0.18-pre2
- 71-bit-mul24-kernel working for all tests:
  - fixed bit-shifting offset in square_72_144_shl
	- fixed carry in sub72
- unrolled the modulo loop in the 95-bit kernel: 10% faster
