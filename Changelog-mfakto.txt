version 0.07 (2011-08-10)
- vectorized barrett kernels
- re-enabled the MODBASECASE checks
- removed crash-workaround from barrett kernels
  (no longer needed since Catalyst 11.7): +3%
- fixed index-evaluation in barrett kernels
- fix for bitshifts of >31 bits in barrett kernels
- fixed a few compiler warnings
- improved error handling for bad config
- added "-d c" switch to force running on CPU
- added warning when no atomics are available
- added option for debuggable kernel code
- fixed/optimized limits for preprocessing on CPU

version 0.06 (2011-07-09)
- ported barrett kernels for 79 and 92 bit factor sizes
- added support for GPUs without atomics (HD4xxx)
- dropped 2- and 16-wide vectors
- optimization in the 24-bit kernels: +3%
- added a few testcases to the short selftest
- SievePrimes auto-adjust now working (still not optimal)
- slightly faster sieve-initialization per class

version 0.05 (2011-06-19)
- fixed 72-bit subtraction (in various places) as per TheJudger's comment
  on www.mersenneforum.org - Thanks for the hint!
- fixed boundaries for 95-bit kernel (-st failures)
- added vectorized versions of the 72-bit kernel (2, 4, 8, 16 wide)
- added VectorSize config item to select one of the vectorized kernels
- added GridSize=4 (up to 2M threads per grid)
- combined the "if (a>b) sub(a,b)" to a "sub_if_gt" without any "if"s
  (only conditional moves - prerequisite for the vector approach)
- moved the new DETAILED_INFO and CL_PERFORMANCE_INFO debug defines to
  params.h
- added GPLv3 headers everywhere

version 0.04 (2011-06-09)
- first version to go out to some people
- cleanup of
  - unused code
	- cuda-references and workarounds
  - removed OpenCL-example-code
- merged in the signal handler from mfaktc 0.18-pre2
- 71-bit-mul24-kernel working for all tests:
  - fixed bit-shifting offset in square_72_144_shl
	- fixed carry in sub72
- unrolled the modulo loop in the 95-bit kernel: 10% faster
