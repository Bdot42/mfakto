Test-DONE
=========

+ sub_if_gte (avoid branches/if ...)  +small enh+ (also needed for vectors)
- __local tmps instead of res->... intermediates?  - no effect -
- inline small functions (automatically done)
- divergent branches (bad, bad, bad)
- select vs. "... ? ... : ..." 
+ 3x24-bit kernel
- ((x<<8)>>8) instead of (x&0xFFFFFF)   (found in the forum) : no difference at all!
+ loop-unroll: OK, 64-loop in mod: unrolled 10% faster on GPU, no (big) change on CPU
+ vectorize (4 FC's at once?)
+ mad(ulong, ...) runs implicit I_TO_F + MULADD_e (float) ... SLOW!!!
+ hi= (hi << 1) + ((lo & 0x8000000000000000) ? 1 : 0) faster than (hi<<1)+(lo>>63ULL)

Test-TODO
=========
- 4x24-bit kernel
- in mod144_72: if q.d5!=0 ... will most likely skip the first block for one in 19 executions. Is that worth it?

1 find out why 0.13/0.14 were faster for some kernels
2 build test kernels to auto-detect DP vs. SP and mul24 vs. mul32 performance
2 MODBASECASE errors in 6x15bit-kernels
2 Try and build an assembler kernel for GCN (find possible optimizations like carry, mul24_hi, scalar unit etc)
2 Auto-adjust VectorSize per kernel
3 add James' PM1-F-vs-TF-NF list to selftest
3 serialize memory access for vector kernels
3 make/allow for small exps/bit-levels
3 SDK 2.6: __attribute__((always_inline)), set environment variable GPU_ASYNC_MEM_COPY=2, Profiler, __kernel __attribute__((vec_type_hint(uintn)))
3 test different local workgroup sizes, also in combination with the __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) qualifier
3 test speed without event sync (just in-order-queue)
3 Performance: vectorize GPU-sieve / reading from sieve
3 auto-optimizer: parameterize possible uses of mad_hi, amd_bitalign and others, let a test mode find out about the best config
4 dummy kernel for performance testing of sieve and transfer
4 kernel trace more specific (bitmask)
4 error handling: RES[0] -= 100; save up to 3 ints in RES; only in single-vec
4 clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo in load kernels: preferred size, local mem
4 Complete instuctions on building on Windows(VS and MinGW)
5 div/mul-modulo for 96 bits
5 cleanup: separate GPU- and CPU-sieve based kernels, compile and load only one set of them
5 repunit

OpenCL 2.0 (per #ifdef): clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties instead of clCreateCommandQueue: use device queue: requires out-of-order queues: need events
merge mfaktc changes: small exps: should correct failing test
