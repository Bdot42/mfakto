# SievePrimes defines how far the factor candidates (FCs) are pre-sieved on the
# CPU. The first <SievePrimes> odd primes are used to sieve the FCs.
#
# Minimum: SievePrimes=SievePrimesMin
# Maximum: SievePrimes=SievePrimesMax
#
# Default: SievePrimes=25000

# 1 = enabled
#
# Default: SievePrimesAdjust=1

SievePrimesAdjust=1


# If SievePrimesAdjust=1, then SievePrimesMin defines the lower limit for
# SievePrimes. Lower values may reduce CPU consumption,
# higher values enforce a higher TF efficiency at the cost of more
# CPU resources. Lowering this value below 5000 is not advised as
# that dramatically reduces the quality of the siever output, increasing
# the share of futile GPU work (due to testing composite factor candidates).
#
# Minimum: SievePrimesMin=256
# Maximum: SievePrimesMin=999999
#
# Default: SievePrimesMin=5000

SievePrimesMin=5000


# If SievePrimesAdjust=1, then SievePrimesMax defines the upper limit for
# SievePrimes. Lower values reduce main memory consumption
# (8k per 1k SievePrimesMax). Higher values allow for higher sieving if enough
# CPU resources are available.
#
# Minimum: SievePrimesMax=5000
# Maximum: SievePrimesMax=1000000
#
# Default: SievePrimesMax=200000

SievePrimesMax=200000


# The following value is used only, if SIEVE_SIZE_LIMIT was not set when compiling.
# Define the block size of the sieve in kiB. For small SievePrimes values, the
# size of the L1 cache is a good choice, starting at SievePrimes ~ 100000,
# bigger values are more efficient. Use mfakto --perftest to test your CPU
# for the best values. Intel CPUs often have 32 kiB L1 cache, AMD 64 kiB,
# Bulldozer 16 kiB. On Bulldozer, however, it makes more sense to use the
# L2 cache size, 256 kiB.
#
# Minimum: SieveSizeLimit=12
# Maximum: SieveSizeLimit=2000   (not enforced, but maximum useful value)
#
# Default: SieveSizeLimit=64

SieveSizeLimit=64


# Set the number of data sets used by mfakto.
# NumStreams must be >= 1. In this case mfakto can process one
# data set on the GPU while the CPU preprocesses the next one. When
# NumStreams is >= 2 than the time needed to upload (CPU->GPU transfer)
# the data sets can be hidden (if the hardware supports it, but OpenCL
# does not yet support this).
# On Linux systems 3 seems a good number. There are comments that
# Windows systems need a greater number of streams.
# A greater number increases the memory consumed by mfakto (host and GPU
# memory). The current limit for the number of streams is 10!
#
# Default: NumStreams=3

NumStreams=3


# Set the number of factor candidates that a single GPU-thread will work
# on in parallel. This increases the execution unit utilization but
# requires more registers. When more space is needed than available in
# registers, then (slow) scratchpad memory (global memory) will be used.
# On most hardware this will start happening at vector size 8.
# On a HD6870, a vector size of 4 is fastest except for the barrett_92
# kernel which runs about 0.8% faster with vector size 8.
# The barrett24 kernel is fastest with vector size 8.
# On GCN (HD77xx-HD79xx), use VectorSize=2 as there are less registers available.
#
# Allowed sizes are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
#
# Default: VectorSize=2

VectorSize=2


# The GridSize sets the number of threads per grid (how many GPU threads are
# started at once). (not used when sieving on GPU)

#   GridSize = 3: threads per grid = 1048576
#   GridSize = 4: threads per grid = 2097152
# A smaller GridSize has more overhead than a bigger GridSize for long
# running jobs. For really small jobs there can be a small benefit on
# computation time if the GridSize is small. A smaller GridSize directly
# reduces the runtime per kernel launch and might result in a better
# interactivity and may be required for a stable UI on slower GPUs.

# Newer AMD drivers cause high CPU load when many kernels are scheduled on the GPU. To avoid

# The disadvantage is, that after enqueueing <FlushInterval> kernels, mfakto waits for the GPU
# queue to become empty, causing the GPU to idle for a brief moment until the next kernel is
# scheduled. Can cost ~ 1% performance.
# This setting is likely to disappear once I found a better way to circumvent this AMD bug.
