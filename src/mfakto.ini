# SievePrimes defines how far the factor candidates (FCs) are pre-sieved on the

# Default: SievePrimesAdjust=1

SievePrimesAdjust=1


# SievePrimesMin defines the lower limit for SievePrimes. Lower values may
# reduce CPU consumption while higher values improve efficiency at the cost of
# more CPU resources. Lowering this value below 5000 is not advised as
# that dramatically reduces the quality of the sieve and increases the share of
# wasted GPU cycles due to testing composite factor candidates.
#
# Only used when SievePrimesAdjust=1
#
# Minimum: SievePrimesMin=256
# Maximum: SievePrimesMin=999999
#
# Default: SievePrimesMin=5000

SievePrimesMin=5000


# SievePrimesMax defines the upper limit for SievePrimes. Lower values reduce
# main memory consumption (approximately 8000 * SievePrimesMax / 1000 in bytes)
# while higher values allow for more sieving given enough CPU resources.
#
# Only used when SievePrimesAdjust=1
#
# Minimum: SievePrimesMax=5000

# Defines the sieve block size in kiB. Only used if SIEVE_SIZE_LIMIT was not
# set during compilation.
# For small SievePrimes values starting at ~100000, the L1 cache size is a good
# choice. Intel CPUs usually have 32 kiB while most AMD processors have 64 kiB.
# However, the L1 cache is only 16 kiB on Bulldozer, so it makes more sense to
# use the L2 cache size, 256 kiB.
#
# Larger values are generally better. You can use the --perftest option to find
# the best values.

# Minimum: SieveSizeLimit=12
# Maximum: SieveSizeLimit=2000 (not enforced, but maximum useful value)

# Sets the number of data sets to use.
# mfakto can process one data set on the GPU while the CPU prepares the next
# one. The time needed to transfer the data sets from the CPU to the GPU can be
# reduced when NumStreams=2 or greater. It is recommended to use NumStreams=3
# on Linux systems and higher values on Windows. A larger number increases both
# the host and GPU memory used by mfakto.
#
# Minimum: NumStreams=1
# Maximum: NumStreams=10
#
# Default: NumStreams=3

NumStreams=3


# Sets the number of factor candidates a single GPU thread will test in
# parallel. A larger value increases the execution unit utilization but
# requires more registers. If mfakto needs more storage than available, then
# the slower scratchpad memory will be used. On most hardware, this happens at
# a vector size of 8 or above.
# Testing on a Radeon HD 6870 has shown that VectorSize=8 is the fastest for
# the barrett92 (about 0.8% faster than VectorSize=4 in this case) and
# barrett24 kernels. For everything else, a vector size of 4 gives the best
# performance.
# It is recommended to use VectorSize=2 on the Radeon HD 7700 - 7900 series as
# there are less registers available.
#
# Allowed values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

#   GridSize = 3: threads per grid = 1048576
#   GridSize = 4: threads per grid = 2097152
# A smaller value results in more overhead for long-running jobs but can
# slightly improve performance for very small assignments. It directly reduces
# the run time per kernel launch and can result in better responsiveness,
# especially on older GPUs.
